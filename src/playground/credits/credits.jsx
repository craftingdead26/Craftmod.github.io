            <h2>Translators</h2>
            <p>
                More than 100 people have helped translate TurboWarp and its addons into many languages â€”
                far more than we could hope to list here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Penguinmod is (very very slowly) getting translated into other languages, in the future
                hopefully the same number of languages can be supported. It'll take a while until we get there though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dinosaurmod is not getting translated into other languages because this is edited by one person, in the very future
                we hope the same languages can be supported. It's going to take a long while until we get to the number of languages.
